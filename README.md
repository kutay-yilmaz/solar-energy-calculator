# Solar Energy Yield Calculator

Simple Python script to estimate daily, monthly, and yearly energy production for a Solar PV system.

## How It Works
The calculator takes 3 inputs from the user:
1. **Panel Power (Watts):** e.g., 455 W
2. **Number of Panels:** Total count in the string.
3. **Peak Sun Hours (h):** Average daily sun duration (e.g., 5.5 hours for Mersin).

It uses a standard **Performance Ratio (PR) of 0.80** to account for system losses (temperature, dust, cables).

## Example Output
--- CALCULATION RESULTS --- Total System Size: 10.92 kWp Daily Production : 45.43 kWh Monthly Production: 1362.82 kWh Yearly Production : 16353.80 kWh
