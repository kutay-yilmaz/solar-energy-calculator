# Solar Energy Yield & Efficiency Calculator

This repository provides advanced simulation tools for Solar PV performance analysis, focusing on energy yield, environmental loss factors, and system types.

## My Projects

### 1. Solar Energy Yield (`solar_calc.py`)
Basic calculator to estimate daily and yearly energy production using panel wattage and peak sun hours.

### 2. Efficiency & Shading Study (`solar_efficiency_analysis.py`)
Simulates how temperature and shading affect panel efficiency.
- Implements temperature coefficient loss.
- Visualizes performance degradation in high-temperature regions.

### 3. Tracking System Comparison (`solar_tracking_comparison.py`)
A mathematical comparison between fixed-tilt panels and single-axis solar trackers.
- Analyzes cosine loss for static systems.
- Visualizes the energy gain achieved by tracking the sun's position.
